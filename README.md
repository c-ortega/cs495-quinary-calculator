How-To Manual:

Task Division:
- Chris: tests / square root
- Emmaline: basic math computations (addition, subtraction, etc.)
- Tierra: toggle (this ended up being completed in the UI and base functionality, so switched tasks to readme)
- Trinity: UI
- Alex: base functionality

Team Meetings:
- September 2nd, 3:30-4pm
  - RB 395 (CS workroom)
  - All members in attendence
  - We confirmed the division of tasks that we had outlined at the end of class. We then discussed timelines on when everyone could complete their part and any blockers that might come up.
