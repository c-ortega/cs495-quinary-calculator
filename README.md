How-To Manual:
- Clone the repository to your device.
- Run [pip install -r requirements.txt] to ensure all dependencies are met.
- The user should run the UI.py file for the calculator to appear.

Task Division:
- Chris: tests / square root functionality 
- Emmaline: basic math computations (addition, subtraction, etc.)
- Tierra: toggle functionality (this ended up being completed in the UI and base functionality, so switched tasks to readme)
- Trinity: UI
- Alex: base functionality

Team Meetings:
- September 2nd, 3:30-4pm
  - RB 395 (CS workroom)
  - All members in attendence
  - We confirmed the division of tasks that we had outlined at the end of class. We then discussed timelines on when everyone could complete their part and any blockers that might come up.
