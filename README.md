# cs495-quinary-calculator

A Quinary Calculator is a calculator that performs operations using the base 5 number system. As the only digits used are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, the decimal number 5 would be represented in quinary by 10. 11 in quinary is 6 in decimal and that pattern continues on. This calculator performs all of the standard operations but can also switch between the two number systems.

How-To Manual:
- Clone the repository to your device.
- Run [pip install -r requirements.txt] to ensure all dependencies are met.
- The user should run the UI.py file for the calculator to appear.
- Clicking on the decimal checkbox will toggle the calculator from the quinary system to the decimal system.

Task Division:
- Chris: tests / square root functionality 
- Emmaline: basic math computations (addition, subtraction, etc.)
- Trinity: UI
- Alex: base functionality
- Tierra: toggle functionality (this ended up being completed in the UI and base functionality, so switched tasks to readme)

Team Meetings:
- September 2nd, 3:30-4pm
  - RB 395 (CS workroom)
  - All members in attendence
  - We confirmed the division of tasks that we had outlined at the end of class. We then discussed timelines on when everyone could complete their part and any blockers that might come up.
